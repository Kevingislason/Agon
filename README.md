## About

"Agon (Classical Greek ἀγών) is an ancient Greek term for a struggle or contest. This could be a contest in athletics, in chariot or horse racing, or in music or literature at a public festival in ancient Greece."
-Wikipedia

Agon is a selective online publishing platform. Editorial responsibilities are decentralized--participants rank their peers in order for their own work to be considered; the algorithm decides what gets published.

## Todos

-As it stands, Agon relies on good faith; need to implement a system to stop users from making multiple account to vote up their own submissions or from voting on submissions without reading them. The former requires some research on IP recording/proxy detection/similar (might be tricky), later can be done algorithmically (penalize users for voting for submissions that get eliminated.

-Implement actual publishing cycles. We could publish periodically, or when ste reaches a certain number of submissions; advantages & disadvantages to be weighed..
