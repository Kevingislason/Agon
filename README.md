"Agon (Classical Greek ἀγών) is an ancient Greek term for a struggle or contest. This could be a contest in athletics, in chariot or horse racing, or in music or literature at a public festival in ancient Greece."
-Wikipedia

Agon is a selective online publishing platform. Editorial responsibilities are decentralized--participants rank their peers in order for their own work to be considered; the algorithm decides what gets published.
